/*
* This class is responsible for accumulating (holding) real-time iBeacon readings and dispatching them every
* DISPATCH_INTERVAL interval. It is meant to only be accessed from within this package.
*
* When the time comes, it will fire the callback onBleScannerResult to the BleScannerListener listener to deliver
* a list of accumulated readings.
*
* It needs to run on its own thread because the listener can perform subsequent actions which could potentially block
* this class's next execution (i.e. accepting new incoming packets), if this class and the listener run on
* the same (main) thread. By making this class thread-independent, after it fires the onBleScannerResult callback,
* the call is returned immediately so the instance of this class is free to do its own tasks.
*
* To stopScan this thread, send a stopScan signal using interrupt(), and not stop() - deprecated because of the danger of
* holding locks and shared variables. The thread will decide when to stop when it receives the interrupt() signal.
* */
